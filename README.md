# hello-world

Hi My Real name is Jacob Mwale but I go by Alsaahir which is Arabic for "The Magician".
I am a male Zambian citizen who loves programming.
Currently, I am learning python and Django for web development through youtube.
Can't wait to work with a team of fellow nerds on a very exciting real world project
